##### This is an abandoned project, released under the GNU GPLv3

This is an old project of mine, made back in 2008 in VB.Net for management of fish catches and statistics.
It uses an Access Database backend and has a somewhat custom interface.

Requires .Net Framework to work, as well as Microsoft Office.
